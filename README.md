# Craps Table
Alexa skill that allows you to play a craps.

When placing your bet, you can specify an amount `bet 5 dollars`. If no amount is specified,
then the last amount bet will be used, otherwise the table minimum will be used for your first bet.

After you've placed your line bets, you can say `roll` to roll the dice.  After each roll you can place additional bets, or continue rolling until you hit your point or seven out.

At any time, you can ask for help. You will be told how many dollars you have left and your bets currently in play.  You can remove bets (other than your line bet) at any time before crapping out.
